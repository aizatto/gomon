# Readme

My goal was to build a filesystem monitor that only executed the command after a file system change.

Some problem with alternative watchers:

- They rerun the command when the exit code is non zero
- They are a task runner

I only want to re run the command on file system changes.

# Example

```sh
gomon watch <paths> -- <command>
```
